# ls (List):
The ls command is used to list files and directories in the current directory. It displays the contents of the directory you are in. You can use options like ls -l for a detailed list (showing file permissions, sizes, etc.) or ls -a to show hidden files.

# cat (Concatenate and Display):
The cat command is used to display the contents of a file. It reads the data from a file and outputs it to the terminal. For example, running cat filename.txt will display the content of filename.txt in the terminal. You can also use cat to concatenate multiple files or create new ones by redirecting the output.
